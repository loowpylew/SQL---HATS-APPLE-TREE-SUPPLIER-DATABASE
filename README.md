# SQL---HATS-APPLE-TREE-SUPPLIER-DATABASE
HATS APPLE TREE SUPPLIER - Database tables, insertion of data and queries using sqldeveloper-19.2.1.247

Closely related to the HATS-APPLE TREE MANANGMENT SYSTEM in respects to concepts used related to rootstocks, apple tree varieties and so forth. The general application of the files uploaded were to gain a better understanding on how to create table schemas, insert data into the specified columns within the schemas and discover how to relate data (Entity Relationships) in the instance users of the system want to find specfic information related to orders i.e. address, tree variety, pricing, no. of orders to higher privileged users that may need to request certain customer information such as their ID Number, name, contact details, orders etc... 

In the instance event handlers are triggered on a website which has to aggregate certain pieces of data to produce a desired output that the user may be requesting. It requires the use of extensive SQL commands where general users are oblivious to such operations and are only required to search for a specific word in a search bar or to click a button i.e. 'place order' which in essence triggers the event handle which in turn triggers a request to the SQL server that stores the table schemas with relevant data inputted and is then queried to produce the desired output. 

In a client server system i.e. a webpage that connects to a database where event handlers would be triggered to make requests to query given pieces of data. We would have to connect to an intermdiary i.e. a database driver which will handle requests between the application and the database. After the driver establishes communication, the query is executed against the database and a recordset is created. A recordset is a subset of data extracted from one or more tables in a database. The recordset is returned to the application server and the data used in the dynamic page.
